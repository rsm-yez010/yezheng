# Header

Let's investigate the relationship between fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and engine displacement (`disp`) from the `mtcars` dataset. Those variables have a correlation of `r cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp) |> format(digits=2)`.

## Sub-Header

Here is a plot:

```{r}
#| message: false 

library(tidyverse)
data(mtcars)
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(mpg, disp)) + 
  geom_point(color="dodgerblue4", size=2)
```
